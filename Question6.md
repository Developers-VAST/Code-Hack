***Question 6:***

<h1>Find largest word in dictionary</h1>

Giving a dictionary and a string ‘str’, your task is to find the longest string in dictionary of size x which can be formed by deleting some characters of the given ‘str’.

**Examples:**
```
Input : dict = {"ale", "apple", "monkey", "plea"}   
        str = "abpcplea"  
Output : apple
```

**Input:**
```
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer x denoting the no of words in the dictionary. Then in the next line are x space separated strings denoting the contents of the dictionary.  Then in the next line is a string 'str'.
```
**Output:**

For each test case in a new line print the required output.

**Constraints:**

1<=T<=100

1<=x, length of str<=1000
