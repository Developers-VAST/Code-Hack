**QUESTION 1**

**#Consecutive Prime Sum#**

**Some prime numbers can be expressed as a sum of other consecutive prime numbers**

For example 5 = 2 + 3, 17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7, 41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13. Your task is to find out how many prime numbers which satisfy this property are present in the range 3 to N subject to a constraint that summation should always start with number 2.

**Write code to find out the number of prime numbers that satisfy the above-mentioned property in a given range**

 ***Input Format:***
           First line contains a number N

 **Output Format:**
 
 **Print the total number of all such prime numbers which are less than or equal to N**

           Constraints: 2<N<=12,000,000,000
