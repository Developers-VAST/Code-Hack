***Question 9:***

<h2>Level up</h2>

Mr X is playing a game. The game contains several levels. The game has a major setback.
Everytime you lose a level you have to start from the level 1 again. But the points are calculated together for all the times played.
Point Calculation:
    Everytime you pass a new level you get 25 points.
    Everytime you pass a level that you have already passed in the previous rounds you get 1 point.

**Examples:**
```
